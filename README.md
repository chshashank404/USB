# USB Forensic Analysis

This project focuses on the forensic analysis of USB storage devices to uncover evidence of unauthorized data transfers. The investigation is conducted using the Windows Registry Editor to examine entries related to USB devices, enabling the reconstruction of USB activity and helping to identify potential security breaches.

## **Case Information**

- **Date**: 25-11-2023
- **Investigators**: Shashank Chatla, A Joseph Paul

## **Executive Summary**

USB forensic analysis involves examining Windows registry entries related to USB devices to gather critical evidence in digital investigations. By carefully inspecting the registry hive, forensic investigators can extract details about connected USB devices, including timestamps and user activities. This technique helps construct a timeline of USB usage, detect potential security breaches, and recreate a comprehensive history of device interactions. Registry keys such as `MountedDevices` and `USBSTOR` are crucial for providing a complete view of all connected devices, allowing investigators to link specific actions to particular individuals. This method is highly effective for addressing cybersecurity incidents and advancing overall investigations.

## **Introduction**

USB forensics, utilizing the Windows Registry Editor, uncovers digital footprints left by USB devices on a system. Analyzing the Windows registry provides critical insights into device connections, timestamps, and user interactions, offering a detailed system history. This process aids forensic investigators in understanding user behavior, identifying potential security breaches, and enhancing their capability for detailed examinations of digital evidence.

## **Methodologies**

USB forensics involves searching the Windows registry for entries related to USB activity using the following methodologies:

- **Registry Keys Analysis**:
  - `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR`: Provides details about connected storage devices.
  - `HKLM\SYSTEM\MountedDevices`: Reveals volume data and drive letters associated with USB devices.
  - `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB`: Contains information on USB device serial numbers, types, and drivers.
  - `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\USBSTOR`: Identifies USB storage drivers and their configurations.

These methods help reconstruct USB activity and identify connected devices, offering a comprehensive picture of the device history.

## **Findings**

The USB forensic analysis using the Registry Editor revealed a detailed log of all connected USB devices, including timestamps and driver details. This granular information allows for the accurate reconstruction of the historical sequence of USB connections, helping investigators identify patterns, detect anomalies, and assess potential security breaches or unauthorized access.

## **Discussion**

The USB forensic investigation provided an extensive log of all connected devices with timestamps and driver information. This fine-grained data facilitates the detailed reconstruction of USB connection history, aiding investigators in identifying patterns, anomalies, and potential security breaches or unauthorized access. The findings have enhanced our understanding of system activity associated with USB devices and provided a valuable digital evidence trail for forensic examination.

## **Conclusion**

USB forensics using the Registry Editor offers valuable insights into user behavior and device interactions. Analyzing registry entries enables forensic investigators to reconstruct digital events through a comprehensive examination of connected USB devices, timestamps, and user activities. This technique enhances the forensic toolbox by facilitating the detection of potential security breaches or unauthorized actions, ultimately advancing our understanding of digital landscapes.
